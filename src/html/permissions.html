  <h3>Hello Dear User!</h3>
  <p>Recently, we updated to Manifest V3. 
  Unfortunately, that removed the ability for <i>required</i> web permissions<br>
  Our extension <b>needs</b> access to the steam website and protondb website to work.<br><br>
  The reason for this is that we retrieve the scores from protondb. And ofcourse, to show you the rating, we need to be able to change the steam page.
  That's all we do, we promise. You can always check the source code on <a href="https://github.com/MostwantedRBX/proton-chrome-extension" target="_blank">the github page</a>, with the option of building it yourself.<br>
  Still, it's your choice to grant us these permissions. If you do, you always have the ability to revoke them immediately.
  Keep in mind, we do <b>need</b> those permissions for this extension to do anything. You can grant us these permissions by clicking the button below and confirming the popup above.
  <br>
  <b><h3>So, to get started: Press the button below to grant the required permissions.</h3></b>
  <button id="request-permission" class="btn-toggle">Grant Permissions</button>
